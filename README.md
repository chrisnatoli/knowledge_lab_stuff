===================

Scripts that I write for my research assistance at the Knowledge Lab, working on the Lives of Concepts project.

Note that these scripts expect there to be a subdirectory in this directory called "data" containing PubMed abstracts, KL score data, TFIDF data, and RTF data for all words in these abstracts.
